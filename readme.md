Lodash Project

In this project, I will be implementing some functionality from the lodash.js library.

Implementing the methods from lodash is an exercise in problem-solving to understand how the methods work. Ten methods were selected to implement and, in implementing each method, the following four steps are used:

1. Specify the functionality of the method being implemented
2. Ideate a game plan for how to implement the functionality in code
3. Implement game plan
4. Test code to ensure it works as expected
